		<h2>The brief:</h2>
		<p>The brief for this group client project was to create a game with a max of PEGI 12 rating, with simple functionality. We would be making sure to have an immersive sonic experience to reinforce the world we would be building. Furthermore, the game would be built using an xbox control scheme. This game would obviously not include any IPs that we did not own, and require us to provide a basic EULA to the department as this game would be used as a demo in promotional events.</p>
		<p>Our deliverables would be a collection of promo renders for marketing to use. We would also provide a compiled .exe of the demo that would be playable on a PC with xbox controller support, and a basic EULA which would grant the university permission to use the demo during promotional events.</p>
		<p>As the brief was very open, the game that we settled upon was an open world game where you play as the titular character - "Glyde" - who is on a journey to rescue his siblings after they were swept away in a strong wind. The game would have a heavy focus on exciting movement, allowing the player to run, jump, fly and glide between multiple floating islands. The art style would be cartoonish, with a soft and bright aesthetic aiming to provide a cosy and relaxing experience.</p>

		<h2>Researching and brainstorming:</h2>
		<p>The idea for the game started off with the initial idea of a character that would be stereotypically cute in appearance, exploring an area that was thematic to their design. The idea of having the player be able to fly was something consistent between all of our initially designed characters, but done in different ways. In total there were three characters that were sketched up. Number 1 was a nature spirit, number 2 was an automaton, and number 3 was an avian.</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Nature spirit:</h4>
		<p>The concepts that were thought of for the nature spirit would be to have a large forested area, or possibly even an overgrown cave. For this we wanted the character to be fairy based, having the character fly with fairy wings. We also wanted them to be small in stature to give the explorable world a large scale, such as plants and mushrooms being player sized and homes inside tree trunks. Unfortunately this character looked quite timid and shy, which we weren't quite after for our main character, and thus this idea was scrapped</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Automaton:</h4>
		<p>This character would have a steampunk vibe, with lots of clockwork theming and imagery. As they were supposed to be a clockwork character they would have a large wind-up key on their back, which would also serve as a propeller for when they're flying. We wanted their world they explored to also be steampunk themed, with a lot of the environment being clockword. We also discussed the idea of perhaps having the game be on the top of tall buildings that had since been abandoned and started to become oergrown. This was nearly what we settled with, however we decided to do one more sketch, which leads us to...</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Glyde:</h4>
		<p>This was the last character concept that was designed. As we wanted the character to be flying, we decided to go with an anthropomorphic bird as a design. Their aesthetic would be built around the sky, and so we went heavily sky based in terms of colouring. A design choice that was also shared among all the other character designs was headwear of some kind, and thus Glyde ended up having a pair of aviator goggles and an aviator cap. We felt this lended Glyde an adventurous feel, while also adding a level of child-like wonder. This was what influencded our decision to choose this character design for our game, as this energy for the main character was what we were after.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Because this was the design we settled with for the main character, the world that was created was one made up of many floating islands. This would also allow the player to more appropriately take advantage of their surrounding environment with the movement options we had planned. This also meant the game lent itself well to a more cartoony style, as the world itself was quite fantastical and whimsical in nature. Due to the timeframe we had, we decided that this would be a project more suitable to split up into two parts, with a focus towards the aesthetics and game quests being planned to be tackled in our third year.</p>
		<p>Our main sources of inspiration while working on the game were The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, as this game captures the cartoony style we'd be looking to implement in our own game. Another inspiration was The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom. This is due to it capturing the atmosphere we were aiming for, as it is a game which is very relaxing if you're casually exploring with a lot of calming ambience.</p>

		<h2>Prototyping:</h2>
		<p>To start everything off, we set up a GitHub page which me and my groupmate could both access at any point. This would allow us to work collaboratively on the project, without needing to be in person. This would be important in keeping our workflow efficient as it would allow us to get work done on days when we would not have lectures and thus be incapable of working on it synchronously. Furthermore, having a GitHub page set up allowed up would allow us to both keep track of what work was done when, and provide proper version control.</p>
		<p>To help start the project off, I created a third person template level in Unreal Engine 5. This would give a quick and easily customisable base to work from while I built the more advanced movement mechanics. I also decided to use blueprints, as although I wanted to use C++, it is not a language I am familiar with and thus I would not have had enough time to both learn the language and also get the game to a done enough state to present at the TM24 end of year exhibit.</p>
		<p>The first movement mechanic implemented was the wall jump mechanic. The wall jump required a collision trace which checks for walls. Using the results of the line trace, it would then get the wall normal, allowing the player to kick off the wall in the direction its facing. Alongside this, there is a Vinterp to make sure the player slows down somewhat while sliding on the wall, while also making sure to stick them to it.</p>

		<p>Flight was implemented briefly, however it just used the default UE flight system. This was cut for the exhibition as it did not yet drain stamina like it was supposed to, and also did not function as intended. Alongside the flight, a stamina system was also introduced, which can currently be consumed via running. The running provides a continuous drain on stamina if activated while moving, while also allowing the player to climb steeper slopes.</p>

		<br>
		<p>Lastly, as the game is called "Glyde", there was an obvious need for a glide mechanic. This was the most troubling mechanic to implement due to the lack of resources regarding how to implement realistic bird flight. Initially it started off by simply locking the camera rotation, forcing the camera to be locked behind the player at all times. Originally this worked while grounded, allowing the player to strafe. As this wasn't necessary, the camera lock was combined with the glide controls. In turn, it only became usable while airborne. First it checks for if the glide mode has been activated, while also checking for if the player is not moving on the ground. If this is true, it adds force, using character movement, with the force calculated using the angle of attack to provide lift force, and bank force for rotation. Finally, it checks for if the player is colliding with the ground, and if so it cancels glide mode.</p>

		<h2>Trials and tribulations:</h2>
		<p>This project managed to avoid having too many major setbacks. The major setback was outside of both of our control, that being my groupmate didn't have a functioning computer during the project's extent in this first stretch. Another major setback was something that was touched on briefly, that being that there was a heavy lack of available information on how to do bird flight. This was luckily alleviated by having a connection with someone of who I could ask with for assistance with implementing the maths. A less major setback was that the diversity of skills between the two of us did not include 3D modelling. Despite this, my groupmate was still able to make a simple model of the main character, although unfortunately this wasn't quite ready in time for the exhibit.</p>

		<h2>The final outcome:</h2>
		<p>Responses to the game during the event suggested that those who came along to view the game were interested in it as a concept and were excited to see it in a more final form. This means that this first stage of the project was a resounding success. As a proof of concept and demo for just the movement alone, it shows that the project shows enough of a promise to be continued into the third year as our final project. The main issue with the final outcome is that it would have been preferable to have had the game be in a more polished state for the TM24. The roadplan moving forward is as follows; first of all, the movement system would need additional polish to work out any kinks and glitches that are still present. Next would be for basic level design to get a starter island built plus some of the additional islands. Third would be to get the questing systems and sidequests implemented, thus providing gameplay and story progress. After all this is implemented, then any additional islands could be added assuming there would be time to get them tested.</p>
