		<h2>The brief:</h2>
		<p>The brief for this project was to make a social media campaign that would allow us to advertise ourselves to potential employers, while also expanding our network. As this was something to advertise ourselves, we had no limitations aside from making sure to promote the idea of the SDG17 in at least one of our posts. We were tasked to use 2 platforms to upload to. One of these was mandatory, with us needing to upload to LinkedIn, which you can find <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelsey-black-b74852293/">here</a>. Then we had to select another social media platform of our choosing. This ended up being a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2Ort8eN5ErCQf4ay_esVgw/">YouTube Channel</a> which is a podcast between me and my two friends who I co-own a company with.</p>

		<h2>Researching and brainstorming:</h2>
		<p>The brainstorming stage of this project was the most challenging part, as going into this project I had no idea what to post about. This will be touched upon later in more detail. The idea I eventually arrived upon for my secondary piece of social media was having a podcast on YouTube with my friends, mostly due to the fact that I personally dislike shortform content and prefer consuming longer form media. Then, for my LinkedIn posts, I decided upon writing long posts about what I think about various topics of game development. In terms of researching I did a brief amount of research into when the best times were to upload posts to LinkedIn - according to <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/best-times-to-post-on-linkedin/">Sprout Social</a> - were between 10am-Noon on tuesdays, wednesdays and thursdays. Then the optimal times for posting for youtube were 9am to 11am on saturdays, according to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/08/best-time-to-post-on-youtube">Wordstream</a>. In the interest of being able to reach a wider audience however, I decided that the podcasts should go up at 3:30pm, which would be within the 9am-11am timeframe on the east coast of the US.</p>
		<p>With this out of the way, the next part of the brainstorming stage was the planning of posts. To start, me and my friends created a google doc sheet that we would use to write down general storyboards of the podcasts. This would allow us to properly plan what we wanted to talk about over the duration of the podcast, while also allowing it to feel more natural as there wasn't any scripting. This would allow us to both save a large amount of time that would otherwise be spent on writing up exactly what we'd say, while also making more engaging content. This also allowed us to plan out what the next few podcasts over the next few recording sessions would be.</p>
		<p>The final part of my brainstorming was for my LinkedIn posts. This was significantly more straightforward, although more time consuming. While I had a general idea what I wanted each post to be about, I used my planning document to write up each post fully ahead of time, making sure to even include proper hashtags too. While this was rough to do, it did allow me to just easily copy and paste the fully written ahead of time posts and post them when I needed to. Also, as part of the <a href="https://www.globalgoals.org/goals/17-partnerships-for-the-goals/">SDG17</a>, one of the posts for LinkedIn relates to teamwork and working within a group to achieve a mutual goal.</p>

		<h2>Trials and tribulations:</h2>
		<p>When the time came to properly posting, things unfortunately quickly fell apart with my schedule. There were many factors that impacted my uploading. First of all, I got held up on the fact I didn't have a logo for the podcast. Because of this, I felt uncomfortable posting sooner than I should have done. Similarly, I felt uncomfortable posting to LinkedIn as I did not have a proper profile picture yet, which I knew would impact how well my posts would do in terms of reaching people and getting engagement. This lead to major delays in posting. In future, I recognise I shouldn't get caught up on these small details instead going forth. Furthermore, my scheduling quickly fell apart. This is due to multiple factors, one being the aforementioned one. Another factor was not properly keeping a schedule set, which would have been aleviated via the use of a scheduling app of some kind, or having the posts automatically get uploaded.</p>
