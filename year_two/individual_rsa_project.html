		<h2>The brief:</h2>
		<p>For this project I had to choose from a list of 6 different briefs provided by the RSA for me to make a game around. This was a slight problem as I didn't feel strongly about any of the briefs and thus struggled to think of what I could base a game on surrounding any of the briefs. The brief I eventually settled on was in regards to regenerative design. Because of how this project functioned it was very open-ended and thus it was mostly self-assigned. Because of this I decided I wanted to aim for a game with a primarily young adult audience, but enjoyable by all ages. The game would be playable on PC using mouse and keyboard.</p>

	<div class="container-md sitemargin" style="color: white;">
		<h2>Researching and brainstorming:</h2>
		<p>When I reached the point of deciding on my brief, it greatly aided in my brainstorming of ideas I could do for my game. I came up with two ideas initially, the first of which was to create a game using an ASCII artstyle similar to that of Dwarf Fortress and Rogue, but would play similar to Terra Nil in that you would have to use machines to fix the environment. This seemed like an interesting concept, if not technically demanding. I didn't go through with this idea however, as I came up with another idea which I vastly preferred.</p>
		<br>
		<p>This idea was a game that would play similar to games such as Sid Meier's Civilisation VI, in that it was a resource management strategy game based on a hexagonal grid, but once again featuring the idea of fixing the environment. You would have a range of machines that you would be able to build which would all have differing effects that would either help or hinder your progress of reaching an arbitrary amount of pollution reduction. The game would be balanced around tough choices and balancing acts. Sometimes it may force your hand to build machines which are harmful to the environment but would allow you to gather more energy quicker than a more environmentally friendly method.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Having the game be viable to play both ways would offer an interesting dynamic as it would allow players to really decide how they want to play and open up greater strategy. Something else that would open up greater strategy would be adding CPUs which could play either against you or with you depending on what the CPU or yourself are after. This seemed the best idea that I had come up with, however once again the scope of this project was a lot larger than I imagined.</p>

		<h2>Prototyping:</h2>
		<p>When it came to making prototypes for the game the process was straightforward. I initially started by making a small hexagon asset, which would be used by a generator to create a grid of them procedurally. Then I offset them so that the hexagons meshed together properly. With the basis of the game done I moved to adding camera controls. I wanted the camera to move via edge scrollling, so with detection of the mouse position, I implemented a system that would detect if your mouse was toward the edge of the screen and start scrollling in that direction. I also added a way to rotate the camera with it being locked to a 45 degree angle. Lastly I implemented a zoom function, which would also influence movement speed depending on your zoom level.</p>

		</div>
		<br>
		<p>After this I created a system that would randomise the tile height, which would be important later on. This system would assign a random float per every instance of the static meshes. Using this float, I would check if it was less than 0, and if so force it to a preset base water height. This float would then be used in conjunction with another variable to determine how strongly this float would influence the height. I then created a custom material that would access this height variable and test for if it was 0. If it was 0, the material would be set to blue for a water tile, but if it was higher than 0 it would be set to green for a grass tile. For a starting way to introduce height randomisation this was good, but not good enough for my purpose.</p>

		</div>
		<br>
		<p>What I needed was to use noise. First I found a plugin which provided a way to generate noise quickly inside unreal, and set it up so that it would be generated before any tiles were created. I decided to overlap two noise maps to make the landscapes be more smooth while also offering greater customisability and control. After doing this, I would take each instance of the hexagon grid and get it's coordinates in conjunction with the generated noise to see what it's value was according to the noise map. This would then provide me the ability to set the tile's height to be equal to that of the noise map at that location.</p>

				<img src="images/individual_project/noise_middle.png" class="mx-auto d-block imgfit">				
			</div>
		</div>
		<br>
		<p>Lastly I created a water material and a plane that I would apply this material to. The reason for doing this meant I could remove the section that set the height of the tiles to not go below water level. This is important as it would provide greater control over the hexagons, and the ability to have better oceans. I also changed the material to have a sandy colour below sea level instead of the original water colour.</p>

		<h2>Trials and tribulations:</h2>
		<p>The biggest issue with this game arose from the scope of it being far greater than I was able to deliver upon in the time alloted. One idea which was thrown out unfortunately early on was to have the game be played on a "sphere" composed of hexagons and pentagons - a Goldberg polyhedron - but I realised that trying to generate that procedurally was far outside of where my skills were in Unreal Engine at the start of this project.</p>
		<br>
		<p>This lead to major delays throughout the project as I repeatedly hit various roadblocks that I hadn't foreseen. In future most of these could be avoided as my skills with Unreal Engine improved greatly over the span of the project. Unfortunately though, due to these issues I encountered I was not able to implement any true functionality and unfortunately the game has no playability outside of the camera controls.</p>

		<h2>The final outcome:</h2>
		<p>Overall this project was a fail, although not a total one. It granted extremely useful knowledge of how to navigate and use Unreal Engine, while also providing a means to expand my skillset by diving into territories I hadn't explored before such as using noise to generate terrain. Furthermore it now would serve as a solid foundation for furthering the project if I intended, which I believe would be a worthwhile challenge to tackle in my spare time. In the future there will not be as many issues making projects as I won't be taking on more than I can handle at once via trying to learn two seperate game engines at the same time.</p>
