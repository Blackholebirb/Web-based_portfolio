		<h2>The brief:</h2>
		<p>The brief I selected was to help make a web-based adventure game to celebrate the 1100th anniversary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86thelstan">King Athelstan</a> that would be hosted upon the <a href="https://exploremalmesbury.com/#/">Explore Malmesbury</a> website. Our target audience was young children, although playable by all ages regardless. We also were tasked with making it be playable on mobiles and tablets so that it would be able to played while walking around during the event.</p>
	</div>
	<br>
	<br>
	<div class="container-md sitemargin" style="color: white;">
		<h2>Researching and brainstorming:</h2>
		<p>Our group immediately got to work thinking of possible paths we could take this down, with the ideas of having a point-and-click style game, similar to games such as The Room being thrown around. Another style of game that was suggested was a more traditional puzzle game in the styles of the Professor Layton series. The reason we were going down this general train of thought is that as the game would need to run on a web browser and also be playable on mobiles or tablets, our options of games were heavily restricted. We finally settled upon making a game with a bunch of small unrelated puzzles similar to Professor Layton. We got to work thinking of how we would tie in the way the puzzles would work.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The idea we settled upon would be to have each puzzle require to collect a key from one of the people living in Malmesbury. Each person was a different profession and had a puzzle related to their profession. Once you had collected all the keys, you would return to the meeting hall to test the keys you had collected on the lock to King Athelstan's treasure chest. The puzzles we came up with were as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Weaver puzzle: You were presented with a weaving loom, upon which were three tangled ropes, at one end a key was attached, and at the top were three buttons. You would then have to select the rope which lead to the key.</li>
			<li>Painter puzzle: A jigsaw puzzle where you had to place pieces of a broken painting back in an easel to reassemble the painting as it once was.</li>
			<li>Stonemason puzzle: You were presented with an empty box which you would then have to help reorganise and put all the pieces back in the box correctly.</li>
			<li>Butcher puzzle: Drag all the meat into the their respective boxes, as is marked on the outside.</li>
			<li>Apothecary puzzle: Help seperate the liquids out so each container is holding only one colour of liquid</li>
			<li>Meeting hall puzzle: Not strictly a puzzle, so much as a simple way to end off the game. Compare the shape of the key to the inside of the lock to see if it would fit.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>With that all decided, the next step was to actually start creating the game and the assets.</p>

		<h2>Prototyping:</h2>
		<p>I personally had set myself a challenge of making the game in Godot, as I intend to use it for a personal project later on, and doing this provided me an opportunity to learn it ahead of time. This of course meant that I had a disadvantage of being completely unfamiliar with what I was working with when I started this project. Because of this, there were significant delays to my progress, more on that later. I started off with creating a basic menu, which would serve as my basis for learning how to use Godot. After putting in some placeholder buttons and showing my team for feedback, one of my groupmates provided me with a wooden button asset that would be used throughout the project in multiple places. After that I made a quick hub that would allow you to select houses to go to for puzzles.</p>

		<br>
		<p></p>
		<br>
		<p>I decided to have all the puzzles except the weaver puzzle be locked at first, just so the weaver could serve as a basic tutorial. This would allow the player to get a general gist of how the game would play, without giving them a more challenging puzzle immediately - as again our game was to be designed to be played by young children. First I laid out the scene with the assets provided, and then placed buttons at the top with scripts attached. Clicking the wrong button didn't punish the player in any way as it was not supposed to be challenging. This part took up a majority of my time to set up, despite seeming simple. However this step also provided me a solid groundwork for every other puzzle which I was able to copy and paste into each scene as a temporary placeholder before I got to work on the other puzzles.</p>

		</div>		
		<br>
		<p>Following the success of completing the first puzzle, with positive feedback from my group, I moved onto the next puzzle. The puzzle I tackled next was the painter puzzle. This also proved to be quite challenging because up until this point I had not had to deal with any literal moving parts. This gave me valuable insight into how to better structure my scenes as well, as previously it had been quite inefficient, although at this point it was a risk to change anything to tidy it up, especially due to reasons that I'll discuss later. Due to issues with timing, and an inability to figure out the correct solution to make the painting puzzle work with the time available left, I decided to change tack and tackle the butcher puzzle.</p>
		<div class="container-md sitemargin flexcontainer">
			<img src="images/group_client/painter_puzzle.png" class="mx-auto d-block imgfit">
		</div>			
		<br>
		<p>My reasoning for choosing the butcher puzzle over any of the other remaining puzzles was that it was able to be built off of the framework that was in place from the painter puzzle, except significantly more straightforward as all it required was placing the meat into the designated boxes. This was simple enough to implement via the use of collisionBodies, much like I had to utilise for the painting puzzle.</p>

		<h2>Trials and tribulations:</h2>
		<p>This project was not without it's rough spots, and this section will cover some of them and how I'd overcome them in the future were I to redo a project like this. The biggest one which is thankfully mitigated entirely simply by me having done this progress was the delays caused by my lack of understanding of how to use Godot as a game engine. The experience that was gained from using it is easily applicable in the future and will be useful going forward for other projects. </p>
		<br>
		<p>Another issue I faced was nearly losing access to all my work before the deadline for this semester. This was brought about from me trying to tidy files up after realising my organisation had gotten sloppy and would be nigh unusable when this project would be handed off, for it to potentially be edited by anyone else in the future. In future to mitigate issues such as this I'd plan out what files I'd be likely to need and create folders accordingly, to prevent there being a lot of files under one folder which could be organised into two or more subfolders.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The final issue arises from the fact the product in it's current state as of writing this is unfinished and still has flaws to iron out. Better time management may have helped prevent the game from having as many issues as it does, but simultaneously our group may have underestimated the scope of the project when we started. </p>

		<h2>The final outcome:</h2>
		<p>Despite the game being unfinished, this project was a success. This is due to two reasons. Reason one lies in the fact that the game's deadline was for June, which means that only half of the alloted time was used up. This is important as the game remains half completed. With the full time slot alloted the game easily would reach completion by the time our client needs it for. Reason two was that it provided me a bit more insight into the challenges of working as a solo developer, and thus has granted me an important take away - alongside what I mentioned in the above section. Going forward I am more equipped to handle challenging situations which may be thrown at me. I also understand I should avoid overburdening myself by trying to take on two new challenges at once as I was simultaneously learning how to use Unreal Engine for my individual project.</p>
