		<h2>The brief:</h2>
		<p>The brief for this project was to make a social media campaign that would allow us to advertise ourselves to potential employers, while also expanding our network. As this was something to advertise ourselves, we had no limitations aside from making sure to promote the idea of the SDG17 in at least one of our posts. We were tasked to use 2 platforms to upload to. One of these was mandatory, with us needing to upload to LinkedIn, which you can find <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelsey-black-b74852293/">here</a>. Then we had to select another social media platform of our choosing. This ended up being a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2Ort8eN5ErCQf4ay_esVgw/">YouTube Channel</a> which is a podcast between me and my two friends who I co-own a company with.</p>

		<h2>Researching and brainstorming:</h2>
		<p>The brainstorming stage of this project was the most challenging part, as going into this project I had no idea what to post about. This will be touched upon later in more detail. The idea I eventually arrived upon for my secondary piece of social media was having a podcast on YouTube with my friends, mostly due to the fact that I personally dislike shortform content and prefer consuming longer form media. Then, for my LinkedIn posts, I decided upon writing long posts about what I think about various topics of game development. In terms of researching I did a brief amount of research into when the best times were to upload posts to LinkedIn - according to <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/best-times-to-post-on-linkedin/">Sprout Social</a> - were between 10am-Noon on tuesdays, wednesdays and thursdays. Then the optimal times for posting for youtube were 9am to 11am on saturdays, according to <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2023/08/08/best-time-to-post-on-youtube">Wordstream</a>. In the interest of being able to reach a wider audience however, I decided that the podcasts should go up at 3:30pm, which would be within the 9am-11am timeframe on the east coast of the US.</p>
		<p>With this out of the way, the next part of the brainstorming stage was the planning of posts. To start, me and my friends created a google doc sheet that we would use to write down general storyboards of the podcasts. This would allow us to properly plan what we wanted to talk about over the duration of the podcast, while also allowing it to feel more natural as there wasn't any scripting. This would allow us to both save a large amount of time that would otherwise be spent on writing up exactly what we'd say, while also making more engaging content. This also allowed us to plan out what the next few podcasts over the next few recording sessions would be.</p>
		<p>The final part of my brainstorming was for my LinkedIn posts. This was significantly more straightforward, although more time consuming. While I had a general idea what I wanted each post to be about, I used my planning document to write up each post fully ahead of time, making sure to even include proper hashtags too. While this was rough to do, it did allow me to just easily copy and paste the fully written ahead of time posts and post them when I needed to. Also, as part of the <a href="https://www.globalgoals.org/goals/17-partnerships-for-the-goals/">SDG17</a>, one of the posts for LinkedIn relates to teamwork and working within a group to achieve a mutual goal.</p>

		<h2>Posting:</h2>
		<p>For my LinkedIn, I wanted to make sure my posts were a good insight to who I am and my take on game development, as I thought it would be important for potential empolyers to get to know who I am and how I work. I also wanted to be able to demonstrate some of my skills outside of game development too. For this purpose I made sure to get a mix of post topics.</p>
		<p>I decided that starting off with just a simple introduction would be a good first post. This allowed me to quickly touch upon some of my skills immediately, and thus I hoped would allow me to make a few connections straight away. Unfortunately this did not happen, outside of classmates. In my third post I decided I would delve more properly into my external skills, and made a post discussing digital art, while simultaneously asking for any tips or assistance anyone could offer regarding it.</p>
		<div class="container-md sitemargin flexcontainer">

		</div>
		<p>My fourth and fifth posts were almost two parts of one longer post. They both delved into writing, this being an important thing for me to discuss as it allowed me to do something similar to my third post with me displaying an affinity for writing, while also allowing me to share my thoughts on my preference for story driven games. Unfortunately, these posts did not do as well as I would have liked, but this perhaps may have been due to any lack of images on these posts. In fact, the trend noticed on my posts was that those with images always received many more impressions than those without images.</p>
		<p>In terms of posts that I have yet to write and upload, I would more properly delve into my own personal programming skills and experience, talking about my group project for this semester. This would allow me to show the work I have done to potential employers in a way that is more cohesive and structured, as each post would be able to focus on smaller key parts, versus my portfolio where I need to present the project as a whole all at once.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The posting history for the podcast as of writing this is not too extensive, with only one finished podcast uploaded as it currently stands. However, as it is a podcast that would be introducing us as the owners of our company, we realised that it would be important for this first one to properly introduce ourselves to the audience, and how we all met. After this, we were able to properly discuss both our own personal goals and simultaneously the goals going forward with bringing our company into the realm of reality.</p>

		<h2>Trials and tribulations:</h2>
		<p>When the time came to properly posting, things unfortunately quickly fell apart with my schedule. There were many factors that impacted my uploading. First of all, I got held up on the fact I didn't have a logo for the podcast. Because of this, I felt uncomfortable posting sooner than I should have done. Similarly, I felt uncomfortable posting to LinkedIn as I did not have a proper profile picture yet, which I knew would impact how well my posts would do in terms of reaching people and getting engagement. This lead to major delays in posting. In future, I recognise I shouldn't get caught up on these small details instead going forth. Furthermore, my scheduling quickly fell apart. This is due to multiple factors, one being the aforementioned one. Another factor was not properly keeping a schedule set, which would have been aleviated via the use of a scheduling app of some kind, or having the posts automatically get uploaded.</p>
		<p>Lastly, the largest factor which impacted my posting and uploading was me not having any experience with social media before. I've had various social media accounts that I've poked at, and a few where I've posted content, but never to the extent of trying to reach a wider audience. I'm also not someone who tends to scroll through content a lot, even preferring longer form content over short form content -- This being my reasoning for choosing to do a podcast instead of something easier like Tiktok or YouTube Shorts. Because of this, I personally felt as though I was coming at this project with an inherent disadvantage compared to others who were more accustomed to both consuming and creating content in a manner which is supposed to be short and snappy.</p>

		<h2>The final outcome:</h2>
		<p>Overall, the outcome of my social media campaign was not successful. I feel that I wasn't quite able to reach as many people as I would have liked to, and I partially feel like this is due to the fact that I am inexperienced with social media posting. In future, I feel I have learned many lessons from this that I know what I'd need to do differently to gather a larger audience to view my posts on LinkedIn. As stated in the previous section, I would make sure to properly schedule posts and post them when I am supposed to, thus ensuring that there is enough consistency in when I upload that people would be more likely to see it. Furthermore, with the accounts all properly set up now, there wouldn't be any unforeseen delays due to discomfort of starting posting without a "completed" account.</p>
