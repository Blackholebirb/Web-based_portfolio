            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>This project served as a follow-up to my case study that was undertaken last year. Tekton designed to be a practical application of the result of the research undertaken, applying the knowledge gained. This case study focused on the effects playing video games could have on creative expression. This included primary research in the form of a survey that not only gauged how video games impacted people's creativity, but also if they'd be interested in that style of game. This research helped direct what style of game that was made for this module.</p>
            <p>Tekton was designed to be a somewhat minimal voxel sandbox game, with emphasis placed on building structures. This would be achieved through use of building tools to allow players to rapidly create and terraform their environment, rather than one block at a time like other voxel sandbox games. Tekton was built on the prin</p>

            <h2>Researching and brainstorming:</h2>
            <p>During the case study, one roadblock that was faced with research was the challenge of defining creativity. Despite being such a prevalent thing, creativity is challenging to measure from an academic perspective, as is the case with many psychological resources. This is an issue that is addressed in many research papers that have been written about this topic. Because of this there are many different ways to measure creativity.</p>
            <p>It is also necessary to be more specific while discussing creativity as a whole as it is very open to interpretation. A key example of this was through a paper that was read while writing this case study. In this paper, creativity was considered through the perspective of tackling adversities that were present in life. This differs from the consideration of the case study which sought to measure creativity through means of self-expression in art forms.</p>
            <p>While the primary research conducted didn't show the desired results of a positive correlation on time spent playing games and time spent engaging with a creative hobby, the rest of the results seemed to show that the vast amount of people would have some degree of interest in playing a game that allowed the player to be creative. The feedback gotten from these people helped inform the decisions for what direction to take Tekton in.</p>
