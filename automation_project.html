		<h2>The brief:</h2>
		<p>This project required us to make a device that would either be wearable or usable for home automation, while simultaneously meeting the SDG 2. We also needed to make sure that the device would be more than just an app.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="container-md sitemargin" style="color: white;">
		<h2>Researching and brainstorming:</h2>
		<p>Our initial idea would be a device that would enable people who were vision impaired or blind to have cooking be more accessible. This would be achieved by having a device that would be clipped onto the side of a pair of glasses. This would be a combination of a camera and a speaker, which would be used to scan a recipe and read it aloud to whoever is doing the recipe. It would also give visual feedback while cooking to help make it easier as well. However this idea was scrapped and we returned to brainstorming.</p>
		<p>Our next and final idea was an induction hob with a built in touch screen. This device was built with making cooking more readily accessible in mind. It would also come with an optional add-on app that would offer more functionality. The device itself would have a range of built-in recipes across a variety of difficulty levels and time taken. The aim would be to allow the user of the device to slowly gain skills in cooking and progressing, while also offering assistance with automatic temperature control and timing.</p>
		<p>The app would serve as a way to get more recipes, manage account preferences, keep maintenance of the hob and also serve as a form of social media while also helping to reduce food waste by allowing you to add your current ingredients to the app. The homepage would feature dishes other people had cooked and the recipe they had used. You'd be able to like posts and check out the recipe yourself to add to the induction hob. It would also show suggested recipes.</p>
		<p>The second page served as a "Fridge" page, and would let you add your ingredients you have in your cabinets and your fridge, alongside their expiration dates. This information would be used to help plan your meals and thus use up ingredients that would expire first. It would also allow you to be able to connect the device to a shopping app so you would be able to reorder things that you had used up.</p>
		<p>The third page would contain mostly diagnostics information pertaining to the device. It would let you know if there are any issues, and if so what you can do to get it fixed. It would also let you know if the hob was connecting to the app properly or not. The final page is the account page which holds your account information. It shows your recent posts, and also would allow you to manage recipes you have favourited, or change account information (such as dietary restrictions).</p>
	</div>
	<div class="container-md sitemargin" style="color: white;">
		<h2>Development process:</h2>
		<p>To start off developing this app I needed to get android studio, as this was a specialised IDE for making android apps. The set-up went smoothly, however when I started trying to use the emulator that was built into android studio, at the time it wouldn't work as it required a piece of software which had since been deprecated and no longer could be downloaded. This meant that I had to run the app through my phone instead. However, this was probably the better option as it meant that I would more accurately be able to design it with my phone specifications in mind.</p>
		<p>With this done, it was a mostly straightforward path of adding things to the app, starting off with making all of the [word] buttons move you to the correct page, and also making sure the pages were correctly named. Then, I proceeded to add the content to each page, starting off with the simplest one, being the diagnostics page. This was mostly adding text as the diagnostics page wouldn't be able to serve any functionality at this moment. After this was complete, I moved onto the home page which was a simple matter of adding content boxes in a container that could scroll. These content boxes would then contain various images of food to demonstrate how posts would appear in the final version. Alongside this there were interactable boxes containing small stars that would change colour when tapped on, to simulate a liking system.</p>
		<p>With this done I focused on the last two pages, starting with the more challenging of the two. This would allow the user to create a new object on a list of ingredients, by inputting the name, amount and the date of expiration. These items would also be colour-coded dependent on date of expiration as well, judging from how far away it is until they expire. Lastly, I finished off with the page regarding profile, which was a simple finish as it just needed buttons placed on the page and another scrollable but smaller content box.</p>

		<h2>The final outcome:</h2>
		<p>This project was a success as it achieved the goal that was set out to do, and gave me valuable knowledge in the field of app development. However, I don’t believe that the skills gathered will be particularly useful for my discipline and what I would like to work with in the future. Regardless, it has allowed me to broaden my horizons and had I not undertaken this project I wouldn’t have learned how to develop for android devices. </p>
